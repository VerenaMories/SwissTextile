Nanotechnology is gradually attracting worldwide attention because of its huge potential in a wide range of end uses. Due to their huge economical potential, nano-materials have attracted businesses. For the textile industry nanotechnology also has real commercial potential.</p>
                        <p style={{marginBottom:'17px', lineHeight:'1.7', fontSize:'17px' , color:'#666'}}>Nano-particles have a large surface area-to-volume ratio and high surface energy, thus presenting better affinity for fabrics and leading to an increase in durability of the function. Also, a coating of nano-particles on fabrics will not affect their breathability or hand feel. Increasing customer demand for durable and functional apparel manufactured in a sustainable manner has created an opportunity for nano-materials to be integrated into textile substrates. This technology can induce stain repellence, wrinkle-freeness, static elimination and electrical conductivity to fibers without compromising their comfort and flexibility.</p>

Choosing the perfect fabrics for summer to wear during this time is crucial for staying comfortable. Natural fabrics like cotton, linen, and silk are a few choices out of many for summer. These fabrics are breathable and lightweight. Synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon can trap heat and cause discomfort. Light-coloured fabrics are also preferable as they reflect heat and keep you cool. So, let's swap out those heavy winter clothes for some breezy cotton and enjoy the summer!</p> */}

                   <p style={{marginBottom:'17px', lineHeight:'1.7', fontSize:'17px' , color:'#666'}}>Nanotechnology is a new section of manipulating, understanding, controlling, and determining the biophysical or chemical aspects and factors of material conducted at the nanoscale having at least one dimension less than 100 nm. The ideas and concepts behind this amazing technology started with a talk entitled “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom” by physicist Richard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) on December 29, 1959, long before the term nanotechnology was used. In his speech, Feynman described a process in which scientists would be able to manipulate and control individual atoms and molecules. More than a decade later, Professor Norio Taniguchi specified the term nanotechnology in his explorations of ultraprecision machining. It has actually started at 1981, with the development of the scanning tunneling microscope that could “see” individual atoms where modern nanotechnology began.</p>

One nanometer is a billionth of a meter. There can be 25,400,000 nanometers in an inch. The thickness of a newspaper sheet is about 100,000 nanometers. On a comparative scale, if a marble were a nanometer, then one meter would be the size of the Earth. Everything in this world that exist physically is made up of atoms—the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the buildings and houses we live in, and our own bodies even the air we inhale. Atoms can’t be seen through naked eyes. Two basic processes are used in the production of nanoparticles: Top-down and Bottom-up/Chemo-physical production processes. ‘Top-down’ refers to the mechanical crushing of source material using a milling process.</p>

Purely mechanical milling can be accompanied by reactive milling: here, a chemical or chemo-physical reaction accompanies the milling process. In the ‘bottom-up’ strategy, structures are built up by chemical processes.

The selection of the respective process depends on the chemical composition and the desired features specified for the nanoparticles. Also, there are Sol-gel syntheses (the production of a gel from powder-shaped materials) which are wet-chemical processes for producing porous nanomaterials). Nano Textiles can be produced by a variety of methods. The key difference among them is whether synthetic nanoparticles are integrated into the fibres or the textile, or are applied as a coating on the surface whether nanoparticles are added to the nanoscale fibres or coating.
